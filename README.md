# HeartRate Tracker

Welcome to the **HeartRate Tracker** project — a simple web app I built using ASP.NET Core MVC to help track and manage heart rate data over time. It’s designed with a clean MVC structure and uses Entity Framework Core for database operations.

This project is a great starting point for anyone learning how to build full-stack applications with C# and .NET, or for those looking to extend it with features like user accounts, charts, or API integration.
